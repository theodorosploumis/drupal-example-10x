Automatic Updates
---------------

Package Manager is a framework for updating Drupal core and installing contributed modules and themes via Composer. It has no user interface, but it provides an API for creating a temporary copy of the current site, making changes to the copy, and then syncing those changes back into the live site.

### Automatic Updates Initiative

Follow and read more on the [Automatic Updates Initiative overview and roadmap](https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2940731).

### Updating contrib modules and themes

Automatic Updates includes a sub-module, Automatic Updates Extensions, which supports updating contributed modules and themes.

⚠️ ☢️️ **Automatic Updates Extensions is still experimental and under heavy development.** We encourage you to test it in your local development environment, or another low-stakes testing situation, but it is emphatically NOT ready for use in a production environment. ☢️ ⚠️
