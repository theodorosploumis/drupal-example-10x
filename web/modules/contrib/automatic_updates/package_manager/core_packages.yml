# This file exists so that \Drupal\package_manager\ComposerUtility can discern
# which installed packages are considered part of Drupal core. There's no way
# to tell by package type alone, since these packages have varying types, but
# are all part of Drupal core's repository. This file is for internal use and
# may be changed or removed at any time. Code external to Package Manager
# should not use it in any way.
