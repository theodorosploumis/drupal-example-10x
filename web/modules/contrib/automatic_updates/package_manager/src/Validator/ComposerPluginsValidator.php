/**
 * Validates the allowed composer plugins, both in active and stage.
 *
 * Composer plugins can make far-reaching changes on the filesystem. That is why
 * they can cause Package Manager (more specifically the infrastructure it uses:
 * php-tuf/composer-stager) to not work reliably; potentially even break a site!
 *
 * This validator restricts the use of composer plugins:
 * - using arbitrary composer plugins is discouraged by composer, but disallowed
 *   by this module (it is too risky):
 *   @code config.allowed-plugins = true @endcode is forbidden.
 * - installed composer plugins that are not allowed (in composer.json's
 *   @code config.allowed-plugins @endcode) are not executed by composer, so
 *   these are safe
 * - installed composer plugins that are allowed need to be either explicitly
 *   supported by this validator (and they may need their own validation to
 *   ensure their configuration is safe, for example Drupal core's vendor
 *   hardening plugin), or explicitly trusted, by adding it to the
 *   @code package_manager.settings @endcode configuration's
 *   @code additional_trusted_composer_plugins @endcode list.
 *
 * @todo Determine how other Composer plugins will be supported in
 *    https://drupal.org/i/3339417.
 *
 * @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type
 * @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/plugins.md
 *
 * @internal
 *   This is an internal part of Package Manager and may be changed or removed
 *   at any time without warning. External code should not interact with this
 *   class.
